# Signaegeddon
The foundation for this project is sourced from my classmates' "CVSignAlphabet" project,
which uses the webcam to identify letters in sign language and allows
people to spell words.

You can find that project here: https://github.com/BoolVision/CVSignAlphabet

Signaegeddon is a game about defending Earth from
approaching asteroids. Each asteroid has a word or letter
assigned to it. To destroy the asteroid before it reaches the earth,
you must spell out the word in sign language. If an asteroid reaches Earth, you lose a heart. 

## Spelling Words
The right hand is used to form the letter, and
the left hand is used to lock it in by closing the left fist. When the letters
you have locked in match a word on one or more asteroids,
those asteroids will be destroyed, and the word will clear itself.

If you have made a typo and need to clear the word, remove
your right hand from the camera's view and form a fist with your
left hand as if locking in a letter.
